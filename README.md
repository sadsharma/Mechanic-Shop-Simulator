# Mechanic-Shop-Simulator
- Objective: 
  - Create a functioning program using linked lists that acts as a mechanic shop with two mechanics performing oil     
    changes
- Constraint: 
  - The only cars that can be worked on are cars made by Ford, GMC, Chevy, Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, and Lincoln (easily   
   modifiable).
- Needs to be able to:
  - Add cars to each mechanics list
  - Remove cars from said list
  - Service the cars
  - Allow for a car to be moved up in the line for a fee
  - Merge the lists if one mechanic calls in sick so every car can be serviced regardless of the employee status
